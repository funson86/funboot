Glues your website's sidebars (or any vertical column for that matter), making them permanently visible when scrolling up and down. Useful when a sidebar is too tall or too short compared to the rest of the content. Works with virtually any design and supports multiple sidebars.

Also available as a [WordPress plugin](http://codecanyon.net/item/theia-sticky-sidebar-for-wordpress/5150066?ref=WeCodePixels) that comes with a user-friendly admin panel.

Check out these examples:

## Install

### Bower

If you are using Bower as your package manager:

```bash
bower install theia-sticky-sidebar
```

### NPM

If you are using NPM as your package manager:

```bash
npm install theia-sticky-sidebar
```

## Usage

Your website's HTML structure has to be similar to this in order to work:

```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <div class="content">
    <div class="theiaStickySidebar">
    ...
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="sidebar">
    <div class="theiaStickySidebar">
    ...
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Note that the inner "theiaStickySidebar" divs are optional, but highly recommended.
If you don't supply them yourself, the script will create them for you, but this can be problematic
if you're using ads or iframes, since they will be moved around in the DOM and as a result will get reloaded.

For the above example, you can use the following JavaScript:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="dist/ResizeSensor.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="dist/theia-sticky-sidebar.min.js"></script>
		
<script type="text/javascript">
  jQuery(document).ready(function() {
    jQuery('.content, .sidebar').theiaStickySidebar({
      // Settings
      additionalMarginTop: 30
    });
  });
</script>
```

### ResizeSensor

Theia Sticky Sidebar uses the [CSS Element Queries](https://github.com/marcj/css-element-queries) library to detect when your sidebars change height, so that it can recalculate their positions. This can happen if you are using an [accordion](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/collapse/#accordion-example), for example.

You can choose **not** to include the `ResizeSensor.min.js` script in your page, in which case Theia Sticky Sidebar will continue to function (possibly even a bit smoother) but will not automatically detect height changes.

## Settings

### containerSelector

The sidebar's container element. If not specified, it defaults to the sidebar's parent.

### additionalMarginTop

An additional top margin in pixels. Defaults to **0**.

### additionalMarginBottom

An additional bottom margin in pixels. Defaults to **0**.

### updateSidebarHeight

Updates the sidebar's height. Use this if the background isn't showing properly, for example. Defaults to **true**.

### minWidth

The sidebar returns to normal if its width is below this value. Useful for responsive designs. Defaults to **0**.

### defaultPosition

The sidebar must have a non-static `position`, as the inner sticky-sidebar uses `position: absolute`. Defaults to **relative**.

### namespace

Events are binded using a namespace, so that you may unbind them later on without affecting others. Defaults to **TSS**.
